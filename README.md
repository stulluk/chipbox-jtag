## About this repository

This repository is an overloaded mirror in both github and gitlab

I did this trick via:

1. Create both repositories under both github and gitlab with exactly same name
2. Then after cloning from one repo, I did below:
```
git remote set-url â€“add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
3. When I push, it goes to both repos

## About Chipbox NOR Flash 

Chipbox has a Macronix mx29gl256eht2I-90q CFI compliant NOR Flash (32megabytes)

The chipset (CelestialSemi CSM1203) supports programming that flash via JTAG interface.

## Programming Chipbox NOR Flash via JTAG

This is done as shown in the following photo:

### Bad news and good news

After many years, I found this J-Link JTAG programmer from my warehouse and decided to give a try.

Good news-1: It was working
Good news-2: Segger had JFlash tools for linux ( As a deb package)

Bad news-1: My J-Link turned out to be a clone, and JFlashExe was allways complaining about it.
Bad news-2: Probably because of BN-1 above, I could newer be able to read NOR Flash completely (Neighter in Linux nor in Windows ).

But I was consistently be able to read partially ( about 4Megabytes was possible). 

Then I realized that, I could run JFlash via commandline under linux, so I decided to write a bash script for it:

[chipbox-flash-dump](chipbox-flash-dump.sh)

Note the trick: The cmdline arguments to JFlash is ordered !! This caused me to loose at least 2 days. When you write ```--readrange``` after ```--saveas``` it just doesn't save the file !!!

As you will see, this script uses a file called [jflash-chipbox-project.21.12.2021.jflash](jflash-chipbox-project.21.12.2021.jflash)

Enter BN-3:

Bad news-3: Back in 2011, I have been able to read / write NOR Flash consistently via my Windows PC's in the lab. And I remember that I had a jflash project file for it. But since I lost all these data, I had to write my own jflash project.

It wasn't too complicated to find out how to setup this project file. But there were two big questions:
1. Since CSM1203 was not in the supported chips, I had to select one ARM926EJ-S based ones, but which one?
2. Selecting right external flash was easy ( I had Chipbox at hand, and opened top cover, read the Flash IC part no). But what was the offset value ? By reading terrible howto.txt files from my archieves and via trial and error, I found that the offset was 0x38000000

So in overall, my Jflash UI was looking like this:

![JFlash1](jflash-1.png)

![JFlash2](jflash-2.png)

Some notes here:

- J-Link allways pops up this warning that jtag is a clone ! As I said above, I suspect that this is the reason why I can't read all of the Flash at once. I tried to read all sectors one by one, and it just can read without any issues.
- Uboot starts at 0x38000400 !!!

## Comparing binaries 

I know nobody will read here, but let me save if anyone get benefit from it:

```
colordiff -y <(xxd All32m.bin) <(xxd selected.bin) | less -R
```

## Chipbox partition layout

Now it gets complicated... Since the built-in storage of Chipbox was a CFI compliant NOR Flash, linux treats this as a MTD device. 

MTD device is neighter block nor character device. Linux kernel has a module called mtdblock, so it somehow translates those MTD devices like block devices in the userspace.

Anyway, during Chipbox kernel booting, we see some interesting messages:

```
...

Waww!!! Basically, add 0x38 to the header of those adresses, and we will get whole raw flash layout !!

Let me add some more useful data here:
